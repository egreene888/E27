E27 Project

This project was created for ENGR 027, Computer Vision at Swarthmore College, 
By Evan Greene and Mollie Wild. Its purpose is to aid the identification of leaves. 
This code is intended as a demonstration of skill and of principles; it has no user
interface and is therefore unsuited to practical use. For practical use, I 
recommend LeafSnap, a guide assembled by researchers at Columbia University, 
the University of Maryland, and the Smithsonian Institute. 

It uses the LeafSnap (http://leafsnap.com) dataset, as well as some of the methods 
used by the authors of that project. 

First, download the LeafSnap dataset from http://leafsnap.com/dataset/. Then, run 
leefsnap.py.Â It will create a library from every other image, then use every other
image in the dataset to test the library. It is about 20% accurate. While much 
better than random chance, this method is not accurate enough for practical use.
